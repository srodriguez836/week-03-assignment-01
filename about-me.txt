bio: Always had a dream of becoming a performer since I was young. Once I got to college I decided to study creative writing. After college, I traveled to South Korea and taught English there for 10 years. Sadly a pandemic hit and I came back home to be closer to family and to find a more stable job. During the pandemic, I thought about what career field I wanted to get into. A lot of family members work in IT or similar fields and advised about getting into this field. I started watching Youtube videos about HTML and CSS and found it interesting. I played around with it by making a website my mom had made when she was in school and tried adding new features to it. I then learned about the different certificate programs Loyola had and decided to try out the web design program.
